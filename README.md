This program is like a data cleaner for JSON files, which are a common way to store information digitally. JSON files can often be messy or not organized in a straightforward way, making them hard to use. This Go program helps by cleaning up these files, organizing the information more logically, and converting data into formats that are easier to work with.


The transformation rules applied are as follows:

Strings: Removes any extra spaces and converts date-formatted strings into a simpler timestamp format.
Numbers: Changes number strings into actual numbers and gets rid of any unnecessary zeros at the start.
True or False Values: Turns various ways of saying true (like "t" or "true") and false (like "f" or "false") into the standard true or false format.
Empty Values: Changes strings that mean empty (like "true" for an empty value) into null, which is a way to represent nothing in JSON.
Lists: Looks through lists in the data, applies the above rules to each item, and removes any items that donâ€™t fit these rules.
Nested Data: If the data has multiple layers (like a box within a box), it applies all these rules to every layer, no matter how deep.


The program is structured with several key functions:

Start: Sets up the initial messy JSON and gets it ready to be cleaned.
Cleaning Functions: Each type of data (like strings or numbers) has its own special cleaning function to make sure it's transformed correctly.
Finish: After everything is cleaned, the program shows you the neat, organized JSON.

Each function is designed to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that invalid formats or unexpected types do not disrupt the transformation process.

Process to Run:

Make sure you have Go installed on your computer.
Put the JSON file in the same folder as this program.
Open your command line, go to the folder, and type go run main.go.
The program will do its job and then show you the cleaned-up JSON.

This Go program provides a robust solution for transforming JSON input into a structured, predictable format. It ensures data integrity and cleanliness through stringent transformation rules and careful data handling. The flexibility of the program allows it to handle various data types and complex nested structures, making it suitable for various applications requiring JSON data manipulation.

Justification for partial solution

The program might be missing some elements in the output due to strict or incorrect handling of the data types and formats. If rules aren't flexible enough to account for slight variations or if the data extraction doesn't handle complex structures well, some data can end up being omitted from the final transformed JSON. This means we might need to adjust the program to be more forgiving and thorough in processing data.
